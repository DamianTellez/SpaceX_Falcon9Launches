# Analyzing SpaceX Falcon 9 launches
A case study lab corresponding to IBM Data Science Specialization powered by SkillsNetwork.
## Finding the keys for successful launches. 

### Summary:
In order to find what makes a successful launch more likely to happen we break up the study into smaller logic tasks.

1. **Data Collection**
   
   a. Using SpaceX API
   
   b. Web scraping from Wikipedia 'List of Falcon 9 and Heavy launches'.
   
2. **Data Wrangling**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

    a. Data Visualization.
   
    b. Using queries in the database.

4. **Basic Folium Visualizations**
5. **Machine Learning Model**
   
Perform exploratory Data Analysis and determine Training Labels

- Standardize the data.
- Split into training data and test data
- Find the best Hyperparameter for SVM, CLassification Trees, and Logistic Regression.
- Find the method that performs best using test data.
